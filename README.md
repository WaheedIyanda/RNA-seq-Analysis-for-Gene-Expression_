# RNA-seq-Analysis-for-Gene-Expression_
An fastq file from Illumina reading was obtained and the aw file was pass through RNA-seq pipwline, which include Quality control, Trimming, read alignmet and feature count and dwonstream analysis. A feature count was generated containg count of the anottated genes
